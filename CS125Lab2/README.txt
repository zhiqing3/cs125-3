Hi,

Welcome to the ZenGraphics Lab2 project. Copyright and License information is included at the end of this document.

* What is Zen Graphics?
Zen Graphics is a small Java class "Zen" that I created to help
novice programmers quickly and easily create simple graphical programs.

* How do I run the examples?
Right click on the file and select Run As Java Application

* Can I use ZenGraphics in my own project?
Yes! Zen Graphics is provided under the "Attribution Creative Commons License"
The only Java class you need to copy is Zen.java

* How do I add images to the project?
The easiest way is to Drag and drop images directly into the project.
Or navigate to the directory using Finder/Explorer/Browser and save the file there.
To get Eclipse to notice the new file click on the project and press F5 ('Refresh')

Have fun! - Lawrence.
