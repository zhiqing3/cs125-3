		// You do not need to use recursion.
		// Hint: Read the source code of InsecurePasswordLock
		// The lock has a weakness....
		// Understand it and you can write an algorithm to quickly find the
		// secret password
		// (A brute force guess of a 40 character password would take a long
		// time...
		// as there are 26^40 combinations!
		// Your method should find it in a few seconds.

		// Beginner: You should complete this code in less than an hour

		// Advanced Code-Golf: Can you complete this method in 8 lines
		// (excluding the top and bottom given
		// lines and after autoformating your code)
		
		// Crazy Instructor level:
		// I can write a complete albeit-inefficient solution using single while loop :-)
		// expression: while (____){/*NoCodeHere*/}
